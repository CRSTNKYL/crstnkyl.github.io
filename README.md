# iPhone QR Unlock Prank
[Visit My Website](ScantoUnlock.html)

## Overview
The iPhone QR Unlock Prank is a humorous project designed to deter unauthorized attempts to unlock an iPhone by displaying a fake message indicating that the personal information of the unauthorized user has been sent to the device owner.

## How It Works
The prank involves displaying a QR code on the lock screen wallpaper of an iPhone. When scanned by an unauthorized user attempting to unlock the phone, the QR code directs them to a prank website hosted on GitHub Pages. The website displays a fake message claiming that the personal information has been sent to the device owner, creating a humorous situation for the unauthorized user.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to discourage unauthorized access to an iPhone by providing a lighthearted deterrent in the form of a harmless prank. It serves as a fun way to discourage unknown individuals from attempting to unlock someone else's phone without permission.

## Features
- Display a QR code on the lock screen wallpaper.
- Redirect unauthorized users to a prank website hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Display a fake message indicating that personal information has been sent to the device owner.

## Usage
1. Set the lock screen wallpaper of your iPhone to include a QR code.
2. Encourage unauthorized users to scan the QR code to attempt to unlock the phone.
3. Watch as they are redirected to the prank website and see their reaction to the fake message.
